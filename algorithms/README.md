<summary>ðŸŸ¢ Sort</summary>

Used for ordering elements in a list, which are evaluated based on execution speed and memory efficiency.

**What depends?**:  
- time - primary parameter characterizing the performance of an algorithm (Big O Notation)
- Also, there exist sorting algorithms that do not consume **additional memory** and are classified as in-place sorts
- It depends of what data we sort, but while i eazy lvl i wiil sort what i want
- We can optimize algorithms, e.g. Bubble sort if no swaps are needed, it indicates that all elements are already in their correct positions, meaning the list is sorted. So we can use break and short time. But **i do not optimize algorithms** i use their "original" idea.

**What algorithms i do**:  
- Bubble sort       âŒ›O(n^2)
- Shaker sort       âŒ›O(n^2)
- Comb sort         âŒ›O(n^2/2^p) p - amount of gap reductions
- Insertion sort    âŒ›O(n^2)
- Gnome sort        âŒ›O(n^2)
- Shell sort        âŒ›O(n log^2 n)
- Quick sort        âŒ›O(n log n)
